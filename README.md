# Image Gallery Web Application

This is a simple image gallery web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The gallery allows users to navigate through a collection of images and view each image in a modal with a zoomed-in view.

## Features

- **Horizontal Image Gallery**: All images are displayed in one line, and users can navigate between them using **Previous** and **Next** buttons.
- **Modal View**: Clicking on an image opens it in a larger modal window.
- **Responsive Layout**: The gallery adjusts for different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Smooth Hover Effect**: Hovering over an image zooms it slightly to enhance the user experience.

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
