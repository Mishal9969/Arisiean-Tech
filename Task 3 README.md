## Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
## Overview
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two users to play against each other, with the goal of getting three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game. This application tracks the game state, handles user inputs, and checks for winning or draw conditions. Future updates will include an AI opponent mode for users to play against the computer.

 ## Features
**Two-player mode**: Allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on the game board.
**Winning detection**: Checks for all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals) after each move.
**Draw detection**: Declares a draw if all cells are filled with no winner.
**Game reset**: Includes a reset button to start a new game at any time.
**Responsive design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
## Technologies Used
**HTML**: Used for structuring the game interface.
**CSS**: Used for styling the game board and creating a visually appealing layout.
**JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, user interactions, and winning conditions.

## How to Play
Player 1 (X) starts by clicking on any cell in the grid.
Player 2 (O) takes the next turn by clicking on an empty cell.
The game will automatically check for a win or a draw after each move.
Once a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the result will be displayed, and players can restart the game by clicking the "Restart Game" button.
## Future Enhancements
**AI Opponent**: Implement a feature that allows users to play against an AI opponent.
**Difficulty Levels**: Add difficulty levels for AI, such as easy, medium, and hard.
**Animations**: Introduce animations for player turns and game outcomes (win/draw).
**Sound Effects**: Add sound effects to enhance the user experience.
**Scoreboard**: Keep track of wins and draws across multiple rounds.
