## Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
## Overview
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two users to play against each other, with the goal of getting three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game. This application tracks the game state, handles user inputs, and checks for winning or draw conditions. Future updates will include an AI opponent mode for users to play against the computer.

**Draw detection**: Declares a draw if all cells are filled with no winner.
**Game reset**: Includes a reset button to start a new game at any time.
**Responsive design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
## Technologies Used
**HTML**: Used for structuring the game interface.
**CSS**: Used for styling the game board and creating a visually appealing layout.
